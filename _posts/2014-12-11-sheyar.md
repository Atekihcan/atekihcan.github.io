Remember the times when you were browsing internet and came across a funny image in 9gag or an interesting article in some blog and you wanted to share that with your friends through Whatsapp/Viber/Line/Hike? You either had to download image in PC, transfer to android or mail it to yourself and download in android or may be use some application that requires you to login and only allows text sharing.

Sheyar comes to the rescue. Sheyar enables you toâ€¦

- Send text or links to your android device with a simple right click on your browser in PC.
- Share the recieved text/link or open the received link in browser directly from the notification.
- Download and share images directly from the notification if the received link is of an image.

All this without asking you to sign in for any service or open the app ever (except the first time).
